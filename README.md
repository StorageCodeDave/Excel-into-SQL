Here is a project where I would receive company staff personal details and their shift patterns and needed to import into SQL as customer only had this data stored in Excel. Each company would email it in different formats and wanted as much historical data in SQL before they started to use SQL. This is only a fraction of what my spreadsheet did and often they wanted historical holidays booked, emergency contacts and mapping all staff to all the departments and jobtitles. This soon became a very tasking job with no pattern to how companies stored their data. I wrote this so I could populate it with staff details and just the start time and endtime and it will calculate everything for the start and end time then script 99% of the data needed for the customer to get started.
Note that something highlight in blue allowed you to adjust any differences between companies needs and the rest is auto populated with data that SQL needed using the shift start and end time.
